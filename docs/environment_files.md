# 2. Environment files
[Back to table of contents](../README.md)

To make sure the deployed application works, several environment files need to be changed.  
These files can be found at `files/environments`.  
A template file has been provided. In order to use these files, please remove the .template extension of these files and fill in the values.

This will result in the `files/environments` directory looking the following way:

```
files/
|--environments/
    |–- jiskefet-api.env
    |–- jiskefet-api.env
    |–- jiskefet-api.env.template
    |–- jiskefet-api.env.template
```
